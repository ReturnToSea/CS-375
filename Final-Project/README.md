# Project Overview

I intend to create an **interactive underwater sea life simulation** using WebGL. The simulation will feature various animated sea creatures moving naturally through an underwater environment and potentially interacting with the mouse. I also plan to add elements like coral reefs and seaweed.

The user will be able to navigate the scene with basic controls to explore. I plan on using models that I am able to find online.

## Project Schedule

- **Week 1**: Research other underwater simulations for ideas and find models for sea creatures and plants.

- **Week 2**: Load models into WebGL using Three.js, set up basic movement and initial camera controls, and implement initial animations for creature movements.

- **Week 3**: Develop shaders for water effects and implement lighting to simulate underwater light.

- **Week 4**: Depending on remaining time, finalize any other features such as interaction features, polishing animations, and maybe adding post-processing effects.

## Project Technical Requirements

- **Technologies**: I plan on using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and JavaScript to manage 3D rendering, animation, and user interaction.
