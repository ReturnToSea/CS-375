# Assignment 1
I decided to look at something from shadertoy (https://www.shadertoy.com/) for this assignment.<br />
I found Raymarched Hexagonal Truchet by Shane (https://www.shadertoy.com/view/4td3zj) very interesting as there was a lot going on with things such as how the direction, shading, and brightness were changing.<br />
There are also many more interesting things that I found on this site. For example there was a visual representation of someones neural network.
